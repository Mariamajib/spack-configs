# Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre

The Pawsey Centre, based in Perth, WA, is one of Australia's two Tier-1 HPC Centres.

Spack is currently the main package manager in use to deploy the scientific software stack on Pawsey's supercomputer, Setonix.  
The Supercomputing Applications team has setup a public GitHub repo that provides Spack configurations, Spack environments and script automations to deploy the Spack software stack on Setonix and other clusters.
